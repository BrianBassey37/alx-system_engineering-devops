This is a fictitious postmortem on a Software Engineering project as requested for Alx task 0x19. Postmortem. 

##Summary: On March 3, 2023, our web application experienced a database connection issue that caused users to experience slow page loads and timeouts. The issue lasted from 2:00 PM to 4:30 PM WAT, during which approximately 30% of users were unable to access the application. 

##Timeline 1: 2:00 PM: The issue was first detected when the monitoring system started freaking out, sending us so many alerts that we thought we'd accidentally left it on "spaz mode." 

##Time line 2: 2:05 PM: Our team began investigating the issue, initial theories were all over the place. An engineer suggested that the database had been hijacked by a pack of rogue llamas. 

##Time line 3: 2:20 PM: An attempt to reboot the database server to resolve the issue was done to no avail. However, we learned a valuable lesson about the limits of the "turn it off and on again" approach. 

##Time line 4: 2:35 PM: After a series of brainstorming without result we went on a 30mins coffee break. 

##Time line 5: 3:15 PM: after further deliberations and interaction we were able to identify the problem: a misconfigured network setting that was preventing the application server from connecting to the database server- a classic case of "whoops, my bad." 

##Time line 6: 3:30 PM:  The network configuration was fixed and confirmed that the application server was able to connect to the database server once again. 

##Time line 7. 4:30 PM: The issue was officially resolved, and we were all free to go home and recover from the stress of the afternoon. 

### Root Cause and Resolution:
The root cause of the issue was a simple misconfiguration of a network setting. Unfortunately, it took us a while to figure that out because we were too busy chasing down wild llama theories and thinking about coffee breaks. Once we identified the issue, we were able to fix it quickly by correcting the network configuration setting. 

###Corrective and Preventative Measures:
To prevent similar issues from occurring in the future,  the following measures were Implemented: 
1. A review of all network configuration settings to ensure that they're correct and optimized.
2.  Reduction in making changes after "just one more tweak." 3. Additional monitoring to provide early detection of database connection issues. 
4. An improved and developed implementation plan for quickly addressing database connection issues, including clear escalation procedures and response time targets.
5. A company-wide campaign to remind everyone that it's always a good idea to double-check your work was initiated. 

####Tasks to address the issue: 
1.Thoroughly researching any llama-related database issues that may arise in the future. 
2.Conducting a full review of all other animal-related threats to our system, just in case. 
3.Planning a company picnic where we all take coffee breaks and bond over the trauma of the great llama incident of 2023. 

We hope this post-mortem has provided some valuable insights into our recent outage, and that you've enjoyed our attempts at humor. We take all issues seriously and are always striving to improve our systems to better serve our users.
